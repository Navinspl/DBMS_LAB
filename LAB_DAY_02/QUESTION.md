Database Design Assignment: College Database
Objective: To understand Entity–Relationship (ER) modeling and convert it into relational
tables and SQL queries.

Short Notes (Read Carefully)

1. Department

A Department is an academic unit in a college (e.g., CSE, ECE).
Each department is uniquely identified by a Department ID.
Other details include Department Name and Office Location.
➡ One department can have many students, faculty members, and courses.

2. Course

A Course is a subject offered by a department.
Each course has a Course ID, Course Name, and Credits.
➡ A course belongs to one department and is taught by one faculty member.
➡ Many students can enroll in the same course.

3. Student

A Student is enrolled in the college and belongs to one department.
Each student is uniquely identified by a Student ID.
Other attributes include Name, Date of Birth, Gender, and Contact Number.
➡ A student can enroll in multiple courses.

4. Faculty

A Faculty member teaches courses in a department.
Each faculty member has a Faculty ID, Name, Designation, and Email.
➡ A faculty member works in one department but can teach multiple courses.

5. Enrollment
Enrollment represents the relationship between Student and Course.
This is a many-to-many relationship.
➡ Additional information such as Semester and Grade is stored for each enrollment.
➡ Enrollment must be represented as a separate entity/table.

Tasks
Part A: ER Diagram


Identify all entities, attributes, and relationships.

1. Draw an ER diagram representing the College Database.
2. Clearly show:

○ Primary keys
○ Relationships
○ Cardinality (1–1, 1–M, M–N)


🔹 Important:
Use any ER diagram software to create the diagram, such as:
● draw.io (diagrams.net)
📌 Hand-drawn ER diagrams are not allowed.

Part B: Relational Tables

1. Convert the ER diagram into relational tables.
2. For each table, specify:

○ Table name
○ Attributes
○ Primary Key
○ Foreign Key(s)

Part C: SQL Implementation


1. Write SQL CREATE TABLE statements for all tables.
2. Use appropriate:

○ Data types
○ Primary key constraints
○ Foreign key constraints


Submission Instructions
● Submit the ER diagram file/image
● Submit the SQL file containing all CREATE TABLE queries
